        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello my name is Shane Starcher. I currently live in Riverside California. I have a juris doctorate which I obtained from the University of California, Los Angeles. I have also passed the California State bar and am legally allowed to practice law. I have wanted to work in law for a long time. My mother always said I had a knack for arguing with others however, I do not know if that is a good thing. I have a loving wife and a child on the way. I would prefer not to leave the state as it would hurt my family socially. My wife loves the Los Angeles area and would even consider herself a permanent part of the city. My hobbies include skateboarding and cooking. One of my favorite meals I make is butternut squash ravioli. I know soup typically is not the first thing that comes to mind. I am also an active fan of alternative music, specifically pop punk. I hope that one day my children will like similar things that I like. My wife’s taste in music features a lot of loud sounds and screeches mixed with autotune.  <br><br>

        Able to work and communicate effectively with others. Flexible, willing and adaptable to take on additional responsibilities. Good problem solving and decision making with little supervision. Adequately manages time and completes assigned tasks on time<br><br>

         A few highlights of the jobs I have had over the years can seem vastly different. For starters, my first job was working in a restaurant my uncle owns up in Washington state. My uncle likes to think of it as fine dining yet every time I went into work, everyone was dressed casually even the customers. My second job was working at Target, which saw me working in the electronics section. I was the head of sales for a few months in the fall of 2019. Not long after I was fired, I believe this was because I was too good for the job. My next job was working at Sam’s club as a store picker. Which involved going around the warehouse shopping for customers and then giving the order when they arrived at the store. My next job would be the first job after college which involved me working as a tech specialist for the city of Temecula. It was an interesting job helping the city yet it did not pay very well and left me depressed. After that I began working as a ring maker for a local ring store in Los Angeles. During this time, I began studying for the LSAT to get into law school. Luckily I got a good score and was admitted to UCLA. It was during this time that I began to intern under Luis Garcia as an attorney for Amazon. The experience was delightful and engaging. My second and final internship was as an intern under Patrick Lord, an attorney representing the Supreme clothing brand. I would end up graduating with honors from UCLA and taking the bar shortly afterward.
